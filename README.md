# keepit

A simple web app to create, edit and structure notes.

This Project was created to practice the MERN Stack by creating a useful, small app. Furthermore, it will include [showdown](http://showdownjs.com/) for easy formatting

First, you have to install all dependencies. In order to to so use the command `npm install` in the root, "/client"-directory and "/server"-directory.
In order to start the app run the command `npm run dev` from the root directory.

Find the deployed Storybook [here](https://angry-wilson-e61b2b.netlify.com/). The database is hosted on mongo - Atlas.

As this is a WIP the scripts and technologies will be added, updated and optimised continously.
