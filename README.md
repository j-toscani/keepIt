A simple web app to create, edit and structure notes.

This Project was created to practice the MERN Stack by creating a useful, small app. Furthermore, it will include http://showdownjs.com/ for easy formatting

First, you have to install all dependencies. In order to to so use the command `npm install` in both "/client" and "/server". 
In order to start the app run the command `npm run dev` from the root directory.

As this is a WIP the scripts and technologies will be added, updated and optimised continously.
